# An example of using McXtrace for ray tracing CDI

<code>ManMandrill_CDI.instr</code> constitutes an example of using McXtrace to simulate Coherent
Diffraction Imaging. A completely coherent beam is allowed to impinge on a a Phase-Absirption object.
The objects itself consists of a mathematical plane which absorbs according to the gray scale in an
image of a baboon, wherea the pahse is advanced by the gray scale value of the image "Man with Lute".

Both images may be found in the Masks directory.
